# School_District_Analysis
Repository for Module 4

## Overview

The purpose of this challenge was to examine the data of high schools to see the before and after of an academic dishonesty case. Specifically, we used data for the Ninth Grade at Thomas High School. Our analysis had us replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs so we could better examine the data.

## Results
